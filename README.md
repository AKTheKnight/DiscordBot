# AKTheKnight's DiscordBot

This is a publicly downloadable java bot that can be used to monitor your discord server.

To run it simply download the latest release [from here](https://github.com/AKTheKnight/DiscordBot/releases) and then run it in a console by typing "java -jar DiscordBot-VERSION.jar" (If you need any help check out the wiki or feel free to ask)

## Features:
* Build in commands
* Ability to add custom commands via json
* Choose for commands to be admin or not
* Easily runnable
* Small

## Suggestions/bugs
Although I have worked hard to try and get rid of any bugs, they can still happen. If you find a bug please report it on the issues page with the following info:
* Version
* The log (found in /logs)
* What you expected
* What happened
* Any other info

If you have a suggestion feel free to report it on the issue tracker and I will see what I can do

## Setup:

1) Download the latest version and select where you want to run the bot (Preferably an empty folder)  
2) Create your bot account (New account on discord dedicated for the bot.) Can be run on your account but not advised  
3) Start running the bot: (Run the .bat file if on windows) else: "java -jar DiscordBot-VERSION.jar" (It will stop the first time)  
4) Open settings.json and edit the settings  
5) Run the bot  
6) Profit?  
7) Add any commands you want :)  

## Planned additions:
* Package with a launch file (avoid the typing in cmd)
* Maybe a gui for it all

## Other stuff:
##### This project uses:
* Discord4j: https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J
